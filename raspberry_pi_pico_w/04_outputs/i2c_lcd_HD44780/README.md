# 04_outputs > i2c_lcd_HD44780

Based on the code from [T-622/RPI-PICO-I2C-LCD](https://github.com/T-622/RPI-PICO-I2C-LCD).

Connecting the HD44780 to the VBUS power output seems to work.
To be sade an external 5V power adapter should be used.

Also my display is broken on 6 tiles but I'm pretty sure that this is not the result of the code.
